        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are a group of star wars fans who have been obsessed with the franchise since we first watched it as kids
          and it has had such an impact on all of our lives. We made this website to share wit hthe world why we love star wars and hopefully
          to get a few poeple into it when they read what we have to say about it. One of the key parts for me personally was
          the VFX and sound FX used in the movies, i think the way they made them both where just exeptional; and beyond there time and becauseof
          them it helped revolutionised how VFX and sound effects where done from then on.

           <h3>why the VFX?</h3>
           <hr>
           <p>
           the original Star Wars movie had a really really small budget comparied to other movies in that time period
           so they had to get creative and also managed to completely change how VFX was done going forward with the
           techniques they used
