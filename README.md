# Testing

Testing i have done for the website are html validator for all html forms and css validator for all css forms, the validators did come back with some issues they had wit hteh code but i have since fixed these and now everything has come back with the green light and works as intended.

The website also works on different screen sizes (phones, tablets, laptops and computers) with changes on all of them to accomidate for teh differance in size and to be able to show all information clearly to the user.

Some bugs i encountered where not having the video on the gallery page have the correct styling for the width and height so that was fix and all seems to work well now, another bug i found was while creating the sign in page the page itself didn't fit to screen with mobiles, tablets, etc and would only work on desktops my fix for this was to completely rewrite all the css code and change how some of it was wrriten and all seemed to wokr from then on.

### Unfixed Bugs
the only unfixed i can think of is the sizing of everything for larger laptops screen sizes the responsiveness works well on every other screen size apart from larger laptop sizes.

### Content
All writing on my page is my own how ever the images are all from google images that where either free to use or someone reuploaded old photos from the sets of the movies.
The video at the bottom of the page is a youtube video made by the channel StudioBinder explaining how all the sound FX and VFX where made in those movies in great detail.
